# Customer_Churn_Analysis

# Problem Statement
This case study is an implementation of various machine learning tools and techniques to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Here our objective is to find who and why people are churning from bank. Customer churn is a term used when a customer decides to stop using the services of the business. Businesses do customer churn analysis all the time because it is very helpful for a company if they learn which customers are about to leave.
This aim of this project is to train a machine learning model on the available data to train a machine learning model that will predict with a high accuracy which customers are about to churn, which in turn will help the business owner in making useful marketing decisions.

# Bank_Churn_Prediction

# Problem Statement
This case study is an implementation of various machine learning tools and techniques to predict customer churn for a Bank. Banks do customer churn analysis all the time because it is very helpful for a Bank if they learn which customers are about to leave.
This aim of this project is to train a machine learning model on the available data to train a machine learning model that will predict with a high accuracy which customers are about to churn, which in turn will help the business owner in making useful marketing decisions.

# Tasks
* Understand Problem Statement
* Importing necessary libraries
* Loading Dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis and extract insights from the dataset: Use various visualization techniques to get the hang of data. Discover patterns, observe and analyze features.
* Drop unnecessay features
* Featurization:
  ** Encoding : Convert text based categorical features to numerical features
  ** Checking Data Imbalance: , and perform feature standardization.
* Analyzed data using corelation
* Analyzed data using Pivoting
* Conclude the findings 
* Train Test Split: Split the data into train and test sets.
* Build a predictive model : predict which customers are going to churn and discuss the reason why you choose a particular algorithm.
  ** Generate models using Random Forest
  ** Generate models using Decision Tree
  ** Generate models using KNN Tree and generate predections
* Analyzed over fitting and Under fitting
